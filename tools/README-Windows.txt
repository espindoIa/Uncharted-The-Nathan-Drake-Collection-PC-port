Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection - PC port, Expedition Edition (beta)
============================================================================
Fork by espindoIa - https://github.com/espindoIa/Uncharted-The-Nathan-Drake-Collection-PC-port
Based on the port by BilalReloaded - https://github.com/bc160201983/Uncharted-The-Nathan-Drake-Collection-PC-port

Requirements
- Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit.
- A GPU with Vulkan 1.3 support and an up-to-date driver (NVIDIA, AMD or Intel).
- Your own copy of the game: the CUSA02320 (US) or CUSA02344 (Europe)
  folder with eboot.bin and sce_sys
  (the same files for all three games). No game files are included here.

How to play
1. Extract this whole folder anywhere (keep everything together).
2. Start "Uncharted Launcher.exe".
3. On first Play, select your game folder (CUSA02320 or CUSA02344). The launcher remembers it.
   Recommended: the 1.02 update (stability and visual fixes). Extract it next to the game folder,
   named like it plus "-patch" (e.g. CUSA02320-patch, with or without its uroot folder). The
   launcher shows the version it uses on Home.
4. Pick a game card and a preset, then press PLAY.
   Low: 720p + FSR 1 at 60 FPS (weak GPUs). Medium: 1080p 60 (as on PS4).
   High: 1440p 60. Ultra: 4K at up to 120 FPS (fast GPUs; Uncharted 1
   draws at 1620p and upscales).
   In game, Insert or LT + R3 opens the menu (display, anti-aliasing, frame rate, overlay,
   controls); both shortcuts can be changed in its Controls tab.
5. Keyboard and mouse work out of the box (WASD move, mouse look, right mouse aim, left mouse
   fire, Space jump, Left Ctrl cover, F melee, R reload). Change them per game in the launcher's
   CONTROLS section. Alt+Tab or Insert frees the mouse.

Notes
- The first start of each game prepares files and compiles shaders: expect a slow first load
  and some stutter until the shader cache has filled.
- Settings are kept per game. Saves and logs are kept in analysis\ next to the launcher.
- Logs for troubleshooting: System section -> FOLDERS -> Open log folder (boot.log).
- Render resolutions above 1080p are new: if a game crashes there, choose Medium (1080p).
- Low-end PCs and laptops: keep Idle game threads (Performance section) on Sleep (the default): with
  Spin the games' six job threads keep their cores busy while waiting for work and take a 4-6
  core CPU. Keep Multithreaded rendering on (per game; the default) and Frames queued at 1: the
  GPU commands then use a second CPU core. With a weak GPU also pick the Low preset or a DLSS/FSR
  quality mode. If a game hangs while loading, turn multithreaded rendering off for it.
- Changes: CHANGELOG.md.

System requirements and the lowest PC that plays
- Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit); Intel 4th-generation Core (Haswell) or newer, or any AMD Ryzen;
  a GPU with Vulkan 1.3 and a current driver; about 6 GB of free RAM (16 GB in the PC).
- Weakest GPU tested: the integrated AMD Radeon graphics of a Ryzen 7000/9000 CPU. 720p:
  Uncharted 3 27-39 FPS, Uncharted 2 27, Drake's Fortune 24; 540p: Uncharted 3 33 FPS.
  Use the Low preset, 540p or 720p with FSR 1, anti-aliasing off.
- 4 CPU cores: 60 FPS in Drake's Fortune and Uncharted 3 with Idle game threads: Sleep.
- Players report: Core i5-10400F + RTX 3050 6 GB plays Uncharted 2 and 3.

Known issues
- The heaviest Uncharted 2 scenes run at about 50 FPS at any resolution (the PS4's GPU commands
  are processed on one CPU core). Lighter scenes reach 60.
- Frames queued 2 is faster in heavy scenes, but GPU results reach the game a frame later
  (Uncharted 2's NPCs float, Nate's feet sink into the floor): keep it at 1.
- Multithreaded rendering is on by default: keep Frames queued at 1 with it. If a game hangs
  while loading, turn it off for that game (Performance section).
- Recording with OBS Game Capture: if OBS keeps losing and re-hooking the game, the game's memory
  use grows. With an NVIDIA card set NVIDIA Control Panel -> Manage 3D settings -> Program settings
  -> Uncharted.exe -> Vulkan/OpenGL present method: Prefer native, or use OBS Window Capture.
- Uncharted 1 renders at most 2880x1620 and upscales to 4K (turn on FSR 1).
- Frame rates above 120 are not offered: the games' movement breaks.

NVIDIA DLSS
NVIDIA DLSS works on NVIDIA RTX (GeForce RTX) GPUs. NVIDIA, GeForce RTX and DLSS are trademarks
of NVIDIA Corporation. This package does not include NVIDIA's nvngx_dlss.dll: download it from
NVIDIA's DLSS page, https://github.com/NVIDIA/DLSS/tree/main/lib/Windows_x86_64/rel
(nvngx_dlss.dll), then in the launcher open Home -> Ready to play -> "Add nvngx_dlss.dll..."
(the launcher checks NVIDIA's signature and copies it next to the runtime). nvngx_dlss.dll is
NVIDIA's, under NVIDIA's license; the port loads it at run time through gow3_dlss.dll (MIT,
licenses\gow3-dlss-bridge\LICENSE.txt; it contains NVIDIA's NGX library, under
licenses\nvidia-dlss\LICENSE.txt). Without it, or on other GPUs, the port uses its other
upscalers.

DLSS Frame Generation (RTX 40 or newer) also needs NVIDIA's nvngx_dlssg.dll, from the same NVIDIA
page. It is not included either: in the launcher, Home -> Ready to play -> "Add nvngx_dlssg.dll...".
