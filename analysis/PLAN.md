# Uncharted PC — plan for 4K, 100+ FPS on fast PCs, 60 FPS on weak PCs

> This is the 15 Oct 2026 plan, superseded by [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md). Kept as history; for
> current status see ROADMAP.md, CHANGELOG.md and STATUS.md.

15 October 2026 (night). Written from tonight's investigation: crash logs, reverse engineering of
all three executables (1.00 and 1.02), boot tests on this PC (Ryzen 9 9950X3D, RTX 5080, and the
CPU's integrated Radeon as a stand-in for a weak GPU), and research (GoldHEN patch repository,
shadPS4 issues for this game).

## 1. Done tonight (ready for you to test)

| What | Result |
|---|---|
| Private GitHub repo + Actions build | `bc160201983/uncharted-pc`. Every push to `main` builds the Windows package (about 14 min, artifact `Uncharted-windows`). First build passed. |
| Update 1.02 | Extracted from your `utndc.v1.02.pkg` to `game/CUSA02344-patch`. Found automatically next to the game folder; the launcher shows the version. It holds Bluepoint's fixes for 1.01 and 1.02 (stability, performance, movies, 5.1/7.1 audio, aiming, gameplay bugs; the U2 quit-to-menu crash GoldHEN patches for 1.00 is gone). All our code patches now match both versions by pattern. In 1.02 the 2-second GPU wait halts the game outright, so that patch matters even more. All three games boot on 1.02. |
| Frame rate above 60 | Confirmed in the code: the engine measures every frame with the CPU clock (`rdtsc` / TSC frequency) and clamps it to "Minimum Framerate". Game speed stays correct at 120+ FPS. |
| Resolution crashes, causes | **U2 1440p NaN look-at** and **U3 1440p corrupted pointer** both ran with asynchronous readbacks on (584 / 230 in flight), the same feature that broke U3 at 1080p ("dcb full"). They are likely not resolution bugs. **U1 4K** was a real resolution bug (below). |
| U1 above 1620p | Uncharted 1 encodes pointers to loaded data (animations) as 31-bit offsets into two fixed 2 GiB windows (Bluepoint `GenerateOffset`). At 4K the grown render-target heap no longer fits the GPU area, moves to the CPU area, and is created before the level/animation heaps, so it pushes them past 2 GiB, and the first animation load asserts. Nothing simple moves it (tried: the alignment order, another memory context: null heap). **U1 now renders natively up to 2880x1620** (its GPU area's limit) and FSR 1 scales to 4K. |
| U3 4K | 1.02 maps U3's CPU area 100 MiB larger than its table says; at 4K that crossed 4 GiB and wrapped to 36 MiB (out of memory at boot). Fixed with headroom. |
| Native resolutions, boot-tested | U1 1440p and 1620p, U2 4K, U3 4K: real passes at that size, no asserts, 60 FPS on the title screen. Gameplay needs you. |
| Green, tiled cutscenes above 1080p | **Fixed** (tested on U1's intro movies at 1440p and 1620p: centered, full size, right colors). Cause: the movie player reads each frame at the display size it renders at, but its movies are 1080p, its frame buffers are fixed at 4 MiB, and its conversion shader has 1920x1088 baked in. Now the decoder also writes each frame scaled to the display size into separate memory; the GPU reads the planes from there; and the shader's two scale literals are rescaled (cached separately per resolution). U2/U3 share this code. |
| Launcher | Presets: **Low** 720p + FSR 1 at 60 FPS, **Medium** 1080p 60, **High** 1440p 60, **Ultra** 4K (U1: 1620p + FSR 1) with the frame rate unlocked. New 1620p option. Your saved per-game presets were moved to the new meaning: U1 High → 1440p, U2 Ultra → 4K, U3 Low → 720p (choose Medium for the old 1080p). |

## 2. Please test (in this order)

1. **U3 on 1.02, Medium (1080p)**: play past the London pub (the old "dcb full" spot), and check the hair in sunlight (the flicker fix from last night).
2. **U2 on 1.02, High (1440p)**: play for 15+ minutes (the old NaN crash came after minutes) and pick up a treasure.
3. **U1 on 1.02, Ultra**: play to a checkpoint save (the old 4K crash point). It renders at 1620p now.
4. **U2 or U3 on Ultra (native 4K)**: any gameplay, a cutscene, a save.
5. **Ultra above 60 FPS**: does the game run at normal speed? Note the FPS in heavy scenes.
6. **Low (720p + FSR)**: does it look acceptable, and does gameplay work at 720p?

After each crash, the log is in `analysis/<game>/boot.log` (Advanced → Open log folder).

## 3. The plan

### A. Correct at every resolution (needed before 4K is the default)

1. **Cutscenes above 1080p**: fixed (see section 1). Please check one U2/U3 cutscene above 1080p.
2. **Native 4K for U1.** Make the render-target heap get created after the level heaps, or find a third memory area that accepts it. Until then: 1620p + FSR 1 (2.25x the pixels of 1080p).
3. **Safe asynchronous readbacks** (built tonight, launcher option *Faster GPU readbacks*, off by default). Pages of a readback in flight are read-protected once its submission is out, and a CPU read waits for that readback only. Boot-tested: U2 kept the benefit (about 900 readbacks per 5 s, only about 10 reads had to wait), and U3 runs with it. **U1 dies silently while loading** with it, right after a 388 KiB GPU-written range is protected: no exception reaches our handler, which points at a stack inside that range (U1's job system switches stacks itself, outside sceFiber). The launcher keeps it off for U1. Next: find U1's job stacks and keep them readable as the fiber stacks are. Please try it in U2/U3 gameplay (the U3 London pub).
4. **Windows red zone (seen in shadPS4's report on this game).** On Windows a page-protection fault overwrites the 128 bytes below the stack pointer, which the PS4 compiler's leaf functions use for data. Our runtime takes thousands of such faults. Red-zone use is rare in these games (about 340 blocks each, none at our crash sites), so first a counter: faults whose instruction is in a red-zone function. If it fires in play, rewrite those instructions as shadPS4 does.
5. **Player targeting reads the display size** (player-targeting.cpp; the U2 NaN was in the look-at code). If the U2 1440p test still crashes with async readbacks off, look there first.

### B. 100+ FPS on fast PCs (Ultra)

The game logic is not the limit. The title screen runs at about 200 FPS uncapped (U1), and U2 at native 4K reached 112 FPS on the title screen. Gameplay costs are in the GPU emulation:

1. **Measure first:** play with Ultra and the overlay; the performance log (on by default) records where the time goes every 5 s (GPU waits, readbacks, compiles).
2. **Async readbacks** (A.3): removes the per-submission wait on GPU writes (about 10 ms per frame in the temple without it).
3. **Multithreaded rendering** (already in the launcher, off): command recording on its own thread and draw preparation in parallel. Test per game; turn on where it is stable.
4. **Shader stutter:** the pipeline cache already persists between runs. Add a pre-warm on load (compile everything the cache knows before the first frame) so the first minutes are smooth too.
5. **DMA sync:** keep the per-pointer windows (last night: 490 → 75 ms per 5 s); measure again at 4K.
6. **Frame pacing above 60:** the present thread runs at the menu limit with a 480 Hz vblank. Check that frame times are even at 120/144 (worst-frame line in the log).

### C. 60 FPS on weak PCs (Low)

Measured on the integrated Radeon (weaker than a PS4): U1 title screen 21 FPS at 1080p, **44 FPS at 720p**. Rendering cost scales with pixels, so:

1. **Low = 720p + FSR 1** (done). Next: an **adaptive** option between 720p and 900p for GPUs between that and a GTX 1060.
2. **Async shader compilation** stays on for Low (fewer hitches; a draw can be skipped while its shader compiles).
3. Reduce emulation overhead on 4-core CPUs: the GPU command thread and the game's 6 job threads compete; set thread priorities/affinity so the GPU thread keeps a core.
4. Shadow map and post-effect sizes are fixed by the game; lowering them would need game patches (later, only if 720p is not enough).

### D. Remaining bugs

| Green cutscenes above 1080p | Fixed; check one U2/U3 cutscene |
| U1 native 4K | 1620p + FSR for now. A.2 |
| U3 crash with async readbacks | Safe mode built (A.3); please test U3 with *Faster GPU readbacks* on |
| U3 hair flicker in sunlight | Fix built last night; please test (2.1) |
| Treasure pickup | Fixed last night (garbage descriptors tolerated); please test (2.2) |
